# Platform comparison

When this comparison was made there was 60 [certified kubernetes distributions](https://kubernetes.io/partners/#conformance).

I arbitrarily decided that [Canonical Charmed Distribution of Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) is "better" (academic exercise) than [Rancher](https://rancher.com/).

Below a comparison list:

* Rancher is capable of multi-cluster management and Canonical too, however only Canonical offers a managed Kubernetes solution.
* On-premises support on Canonical is superior compared to Rancher, for instance, check this reference [design](https://www.supermicro.com/en/solutions/kubernetes-canonical) from Supermicro.
* Canonical already supports ARM and POWER CPU architectures, while Rancher only supports AMD64.
* License fees on Rancher are more expensive than on Canonical.
